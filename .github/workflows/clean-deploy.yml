# Reusable workflow to clean some deployment.
#
# Deletes one or more deployments and runs a follow-up "clean" action
# (for example a repository-dispatch) to perform any repository-specific cleanup required after deployment removal.
#
# Behavior / outputs:
#
# - Deletes matching deployment(s) via the local action at `./actions/deployment/delete`.
# - Exposes deleted environments in step output `environments`.
# - If environments were deleted the workflow will optionally trigger the configured clean action
#   (e.g. repository-dispatch) against the target repository and post a summary comment.
