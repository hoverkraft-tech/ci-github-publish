# Reusable workflow that performs the end of a deployment.
#
# What this workflow does:
#
# - If the deployment exposes a URL, run quick health and performance checks:
#   - URL ping check. See [Ping check](../../actions/check/url-ping/README.md).
#   - Lighthouse audit. See [Lighthouse check](../../actions/check/url-lighthouse/README.md).
# - Update the GitHub deployment status (success or failure).
# - Publish a human-readable deployment summary using the deploy/report action.
#   See [report](../../actions/deploy/report/README.md).
#   - Lighthouse report URL if available.
#   - Extra information if provided.
