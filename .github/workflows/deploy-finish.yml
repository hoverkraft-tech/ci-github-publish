# Deploy - Finish
# ==========================
# Reusable workflow that performs the end of a deployment.
#
# - Perform checks on the deployment if a URL is provided:
#   - [Uptime check](../../actions/check/url-uptime/README.md).
#   - [Lighthouse check](../../actions/check/url-lighthouse/README.md).
# - Update the deployment status to success or failure.
# - Report the deployment summary and status. See [report](../../actions/deploy/report/README.md).
