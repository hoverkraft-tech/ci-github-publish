  Generate a post-deployment report and update GitHub with the deployment result.

  This action collects the workflow run result and builds a human-friendly deployment
  summary that is written to the GitHub Actions summary (visible in the workflow run UI).
  The report can include:

  - the deployment environment,
  - a link to the workflow logs,
  - the deployed application URL (if provided),
  - an optional list of failed jobs (when the run failed),
  - additional key-value pairs passed through the `extra` input.

  When `deployment-id` and `repository` are supplied, the action will also update the
  corresponding GitHub Deployment status (state, description and URL). If triggered by
  an `issue_comment` event the action can post (or update) an issue/PR comment and add
  a reaction to the original comment to provide inline feedback about the deployment.
